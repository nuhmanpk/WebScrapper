## Ethical Considerations

Respect the rights of website owners: Website owners have the right to control how their content is used. Scraping a website without permission can be considered trespassing or copyright infringement.

Don't overload websites: Scraping a website too frequently can overload its servers and make it unavailable to other users. Be mindful of the website's load when scraping data.

Use robots.txt: Robots.txt is a file that website owners can use to specify which pages they do not want scraped. Respect the robots.txt file and avoid scraping pages that are disallowed.

Identify yourself as a scraper: When scraping a website, identify yourself as a scraper in your user agent string. This will help website owners to understand who is accessing their site and for what purpose.

Be transparent about your intentions: If you are scraping a website for commercial purposes, be transparent about your intentions. This will help to build trust with website owners and users.

Be cautious about scraping social media: Social media platforms have their own terms of service that govern how data can be scraped. Be sure to comply with these terms of service when scraping social media data.
